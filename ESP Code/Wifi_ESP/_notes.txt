ran into issue with firebse_Clinet.

first I could not properly download library using wizard, then during manual installiation ran into issue with downloading olde version. No matter which "Firebase_ESP32_Client" I download all apear as "Firebase_Arduino_Client_Library_for_ESP8266_and_ESP32"

Then when changed code to use old libary there was a clash with ardiono cloud library because both libarries include "BearSSL" implemetation. 

We have decided ot use HTTP client to post firebase requists
